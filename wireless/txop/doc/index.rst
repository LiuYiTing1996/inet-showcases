IEEE 802.11 Transmit Opportunity
================================

Goals
-----

The transmit opportunity (TXOP) is an EDCA feature. It provides contention free access for a limited
time, for high priority access categories. It increases throughput, mainly. Also, reduces delay because
of the lack of contention. Couple it with aggregation and block ack for even better performance.

Transmit opportunity (TXOP) is a MAC feature in 802.11, which increases throughput by providing contention-free channel access for a limited time. TXOP is a QoS feature, it is available for high priority access category data.
